# Investigating-Tendon-Mechanical-Properties
In this study, we investigated the effect of storage conditions (4°C &amp; -20°C) on the mechanical properties of fascicles extracted from a single male Wistar rat's tail swathed in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). Tissue stress and viscoelastic properties were recorded and analysed for both failure and stress relaxation test.
