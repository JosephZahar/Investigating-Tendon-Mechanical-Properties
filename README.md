# Investigating-Tendon-Mechanical-Properties
<p align="justify">
In this study, we investigated the effect of storage conditions (4°C &amp; -20°C) on the mechanical properties of fascicles extracted from a single male Wistar rat's tail swathed in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). Tissue stress and viscoelastic properties were recorded and analysed for both failure and stress relaxation test.

The test to failure is generally used to characterize the tendon mechanical properties. The figure below illustrates the typical stress–strain curves of the three samples tested from each group. To account for the differences in dimensions between each fascicle, stress (MPa) is used instead of tendon force by normalization to the tendon cross-sectional area, and tensile strain (%) is used instead of tendon extension by normalization to its original length.

The average Tangent Modulus at 4% strain for each incubated and fresh groups including each sample’s value are presented in the first subplot. The average Instantaneous Modulus value for each incubated and fresh groups including each sample’s value is plotted in the second subplot.

The figure below illustrates the representative stress–time curve of the incubated and fresh samples subjected to a stress-relaxation test. This type of test allows to characterize the time-dependent mechanical properties of the fascicles, whilst analysing the structural reorganisation of tendon at a microscopic level. Similarly to the Pull testing, Stress (MPa) is used instead of tendon force by normalization to the tendon cross-sectional area.
